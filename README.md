** Features:
1. Add Task: Users should be able to add tasks to the To-Do List. Each task will have a description entered by the user.
2. Remove Task: Users should be able to remove tasks from the To-Do List by specifying the index of the task they want to remove.
3. Display Tasks: Users should be able to view all tasks currently in the To-Do List.
**  Requirements:
1. Create a C++ program named ToDoList.cpp that implements the To-Do List manager.
2. Implement a class named ToDoList to represent the To-Do List. Include member functions for adding tasks, removing tasks, and displaying tasks.
3. Utilize vectors to store tasks dynamically within the ToDoList class.
4. Provide a simple console interface for users to interact with the To-Do List (e.g., a menu-driven interface).
5. Ensure proper validation of user inputs to handle potential errors or edge cases.
6. Test your program with various scenarios to ensure its correctness and robustness
